# FinTech_Project

The objective of this project is to enhance financial inclusion for marginalized merchants in India by developing 
personalized Machine Learning Decision Support Systems. Our team is composed of a professor, a researcher, and a PhD
student from the Haas School of Business. We are collaborating with a Payment Company to achieve our goal. In order to
protect the confidentiality of financial data, I have only uploaded a portion of the codes that demonstrate the basic 
data processing and machine learning structure. These codes can serve as a reference to me for practical applications.
The updating is continuous.


## Categories of code demo
### Part 1: Using Pandas and Numpy to do data-cleaning and preprocessing
#### Common methods including merge, concat, apply, and so on
#### Employing multiprocessing to handle metadata

### Part 2: Using various Python packages to do machine learning task 

### Part 3: Using Google image API to get satellite images
